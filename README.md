🌐 Advik Punugu – Personal Website

This is my personal website. It’s not just a portfolio — it’s my timeline, my work, and the things that matter to me.

It’s a mix of everything I do: programming, music, leadership, social impact, and the way I think.
Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, and structured to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate.
